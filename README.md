- 👋 Hi, I am @Liu2k5. As you can see from my account name, I was born in 2005. I am an Asian boy. I am a normal fan of anime culture (but I have not watched any films for about 2 years :D. I am keen on Vocaloid and games better). I am interested so bad in our traditional writing system (**Chữ Nôm (𡨸喃)**).

- However, my English is not really fluent. I have never joined any IELTS courses, so I hope you will remind me correcting my mistakes.

- 👀 I am interested in coding as well, of course. I have been quite fluent in Pascal, C++ and BATCH (yeah, when I was a student in a secondary school, I learnt it myself before I started learning Pascal, and now I even do not know why I did do it haha, I was such a stupid boy :') ). Just since 2021, C++ has been my favourite programming language. And up to now, I have known just some algorithms (very embarassed ^//^). I will continue to do it at my university...

- 🌱 I am currently learning things that I need for the next GCSE. I will continue to develope my projects when I have time (I am quite busy ;) )
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on anyone, if you would like.
