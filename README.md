- 👋 Hi, I am @Liu2k5. As you can see from my account name, I was born in 2005. I am an Asian boy. I am a normal fan of anime culture (but I have not watched any films for about N years :D). I am interested so bad in our traditional writing system (**Chữ Nôm (𡨸喃)**).

- However, my English is not really fluent. I have never joined any IELTS courses, so I hope you will remind me correcting my mistakes.

- 👀 After graduating my hight school, I have chosen a university. Have been studying there for one more year, my coding skill doesnt improve so much, however. Programming languages I have been learning C++ and Java. C and Pascal are the past...

- 🌱 I am busy. Being busy to do anything.
- 💞️ If you would like to contribute to my projects, feel free
- 📫 How to reach me : who knows
